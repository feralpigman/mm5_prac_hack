# mm5_prac_hack
Practice hack for Megaman 5, version 1

Feel free to hit me up on discord (FeralPigMan#0597) or twitter (@FeralPigMan) for desired features or any bugs you find.

**Features**
* On the stage select screen, hitting A loads the appropriate robot master like normal. Hitting start will instead load the correspondingly numbered castle stage, from left to right, top to bottom (ie Stone Man is #1, loads D1. Charge Man is #4, loads D4. Skips center tile, so Napalm loads W1).
* Loading a stage gives you the appropriate weapons, beat letters, and M tank. For the castle stages, it will give you the "correct" amount of ammo for each weapon also (ammo counts came from Beco's PB).
* While in the weapon menu, hitting select returns to the stage select screen.

**Planned Features**
* Screen frame counter.

**Known issues**
* When warping from weapon menu to stage select screen, the screen displays random sprites.
* When warping from D4, the stage select menu can have a weird palette. This doesn't seem to happen on the top floor, but does on the bottom floor. This doesn't affect further gameplay as far as I'm aware of.

**Credits**
* Huge shoutouts to Pinkus for giving me really helpful advice for starting out, as well as making the MM3 practice hack, without which I probably wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything.
* Shoutouts to Raiden for the MM5 disassembly, and for deciphering various sections of the assembly like a wizard.
* Shoutouts to Baron for some general utility and info sites.
